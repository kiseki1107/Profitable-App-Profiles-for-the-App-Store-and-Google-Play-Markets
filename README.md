# Profitable-App-Profiles-for-the-App-Store-and-Google-Play-Markets
In this scenario, as a data analyst for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, this project aims to make data-driven decisions in regards to the mobile apps market.

The company builds apps that are free to download, install, and made available on Google Play and App Store. The main source of the company revenue comes from the in-app ads of which is influenced by the number of its apps users who interacts with the ads. The goal for this project is to analyze data to help developers understand what type of apps are the most profitable and most likely to attract more users.

## Data Collection and Exploration
As of September 2018, there were approximately 2 million iOS apps available on the App Store, and 2.1 million Android apps on Google Play.

Collecting data for over 4 million apps requires a significant amount of time and money, so a subset of the data or a sample size was chosen to be analyzed instead. There are two data sets provided by Kaggle which can be utilized to perform the data analysis:

* A [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps/home) containing data of about 10,000 Android apps from Google Play collected in August 2018
* A [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps/home) containing data of about 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store collected in July 2017
